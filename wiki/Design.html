<strong>Overview</strong></h1><p>As a conditionally pathogenic strain, Candida albicans can colonize on genital/gastrointestinal mucosa without causing disease, and only in immunosuppressed hosts can C. Albicans become pathogenic. Vulva vaginal inflammation caused by candida infection is one of the most common vulva inflammation in women. [1] However, the existing detection methods still have problems such as low accuracy in clinical testing, high cost, and long cycles in laboratory testing. So we tried to build a product for the rapid, cheap, and accurate detection of Candida albicans, which can be used in resource-limited regions as well.</p><p>**We used E.coli to over-express the Bst DNA polymerase entailed in loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction.**Such an enzyme amplifies the specific DNA sequence of Candida albicans to achieve the purpose of rapid and sensitive detection. Besides, <strong>we designed gene circuits with our core parts gp2 and gp5.7 to suppress the background protein translation and uplift the relative purity of Bst polymerase produced by E.coli, and by fusing Bst with various kinds of DNA binding proteins, we are hoping to reduce the cost of the detection and increase the efficiency simultaneously.</strong></p><h1 id="isothermal-amplification"><a class="anchor" href="#isothermal-amplification">#</a> Isothermal amplification</h1><p>The routine diagnosis of <em>Candida</em>albicans in the laboratory is carried out using diagnostic methods such as CHROMagar <em>Candida</em>, germ tube production, chlamydoconidia generation, and carbohydrate assimilation assays. The CHROMagar Candida medium is cost effective but requires much time to achieve the results, and this method cannot differentiate all Candida species. The germ tube production method is not accurate and has false-negative results. Molecular detection methods based on the isolation and amplification of nucleic acids of the fungus include a variety of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, hybridization, and isothermal amplification technique, which can detect the infection even in the primary stages of the disease. The PCR assay is a fast and reliable method that has not only many advantages but also some limitations including various temperature cycles, the use of expensive thermocyclers and gel documentation system, and variable sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this method cannot be used in low income countries or in resource limited districts.[2]</p><p>We turned to isothermal ammplification to amplifay the target DNA of C.albicans. Isothermal amplifification of nucleic acids is a simple process that rapidly</p><p>and efficiently accumulates nucleic acid sequences at constant temperature.</p><h2 id="loop-mediated-isothermal-amplification-lamp"><a class="anchor" href="#loop-mediated-isothermal-amplification-lamp">#</a> Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)</h2><h3 id="why-did-we-choose-lamp"><a class="anchor" href="#why-did-we-choose-lamp">#</a> Why did we choose LAMP?</h3><p>With the aim to create a rapid, specific and cost-effective point-of-care detection system, at first, we needed to find the most suitable isothermal DNA amplification method. This method should be usable for farmers who have no scientific background. This factor pinpoints a huge need to be able to perform these isothermal reactions with as minimal pipetting steps as possible by means of avoiding errors and false-positive results. Although, amplification of marker sequences should be done in constant temperature by the needs of cheap and fully-portable equipment.</p><p>Considering these main requirements, we have distinguished some isothermal amplification methods and concluded that loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique (LAMP) should be the solution for the following reasons. First, The isothermal amplifification of target species-specifific DNA sequence through LAMP does not require thermocycler thus offers potential advantages of speed, cost, simplicity, and accuracy.[4] Second, LAMP method is highly sequencing specifific, high amplifification specifificity allows the synthesis of a large amount of DNA in a very short time, the detection limit is few copies per reaction, and requires only a heating block or a water bath at a constant temperature [5]. Last but not least, LAMP requires simple enzyme as the Bst DNA polymerase which we intended to improve using sythetic biology methods.</p><p>~<br>Comparison between different isothermal amplification methods[3]</p><p>However, the LAMP method has few limitations, such as LAMP amplifified DNA products can be visualized by gel electrophoresis or other detection methods. However, these methods may require the opening of the reaction tubes and increase the risk of carry-over contamination and complexity. A onepot reaction is helpful and the end-product can be visualized with</p><p>the naked eye, but a nakedeye method is not sensitive to variability among various samples and the detection limit is very high and the specificity can't be ensured.

However, in our project, the target users are mainly those suffering poverty or living in underdeveloped regions. They may have no access to institution with lab environment, or just can’t afford the high cost. To cut these expense, we decide to use the extract of our engineered E.coli to directly catalyze the LAMP reaction. However, there’ll be lots of unrelated proteins in the extract disturbing the reaction, so we need our engineered E.coli to produce our protein of interest, the enzyme, as pure as possible. In another word, we need to raise the relative amount of our protein of interest.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, we decide to realize our idea by inhibiting the expression of all E.coli’s proteins except the protein of interest.</p><p></p><h2 id="ecoli-rnap-inhibitor"><a class="anchor" href="#ecoli-rnap-inhibitor">#</a> <strong>E.coli RNAP inhibitor</strong></h2><h3 id="background"><a class="anchor" href="#background">#</a> <strong>Background</strong></h3><p>During the transcription process of E.coli, transcription factors called ‘σ factors (sigma factors)’ are essential for guiding the RNA Polymerase (RNAP) to the promoters and initiating the transcription. We call RNAPs combined with σ factors ‘RNAP whole enzyme’. Each kinds of σ factors can specifically recognize corresponding promoters, thus realizing the overall regulation of gene expression at transcription level. There are at least seven kinds of σ factors that respectively be responsible to dominate the whole transcription process of host E.coli at different situations, including regular growth stages and extreme hazard. Among them, σ70 and σS are two major σ factors of E.coli. According to Abhishek Mazumder and Achillefs N. Kapanidis (2019) and Herb E. Schellhorn (2020), σ70 is the so-called ‘housekeeping’ σ factor which controls about 80% genes. In another word, when the E.coli is in ordinary environment, σ70 will always be the dominant σ factor. On the other hand, σS is the σ factor used by E.coli in order to counter starvation situation. In lab situation, we typically divide bacteria’s growth into four stages. According to the features of σ70 and σS, σS will take dominance at stationary stage while σ70 will show most significance at exponential stage. However, RNAP of phages, such as T7 phage’s RNAP, doesn’t necessarily rely on σ factors.</p><p></p><p>So it suddenly dawned on us that we can interfere σ factors to inhibit transcription and use phage’s transcription system to make our protein of interest immune to the inhibition. To interfere σ factors, we think of two ways. The first one is to let the engineered E.coli express dominant negative mutant of σ factor. But there’re so many kinds of σ factors, and their conserved regions are quite complicated. It’s hard to design an appropriate dominant negative mutant. Meanwhile, σ factors are quite huge as proteins, overexpress them is contradictory to our aim of reducing irrelevant proteins. The second way is to hinder the ability of σ factors. Then what we need to do is to find a proper inhibitor.</p><p></p><h3 id="inspired-by-mechanism-of-phages"><a class="anchor" href="#inspired-by-mechanism-of-phages">#</a> <strong>Inspired by mechanism of phages</strong></h3><p>Phage, well-known for being the virus infecting bacteria, is introduced in almost all biology text books in middle school. Briefly as the introduction is, they must tell you one phage’s key feature,’ Phages have the ability to shut bacteria down and turn them into factories that help phages replicate.’</p><p></p><p>In the field of synthesis biology, expressing systems of phages are good tools to help you achieve high protein yield. Among them, T7 system is one of the most mature expressing systems. However, the typical T7 expressing system merely utilizing T7 phage’s RNA polymerase, in another word, only materializing phage’s ability to turn bacteria into ‘factories’. Actually, there’s also huge potential in putting phage’s ability of ‘shutting down’ into expressing system.</p><p></p><p>One of T7’s shutting-down-methods is to inhibit the transcription initialization of bacteria by producing three proteins, respectively called gp2, gp5.7 and gp0.7. This process can redistribute the metabolism pressure of the host bacteria, letting them save mass and energy to produce what T7 phages want them to produce, meanwhile, reducing the relevant amount of other proteins for sure. That’s exactly the effects we want.</p><p></p><p>Among the three transcription inhibitors mentioned above, gp2 and gp5.7 are both binding proteins of RNAP whole-enzyme, while gp0.7 is a kinase with low specificity. In order to ensure the system’s robustness, we select gp2 and gp5.7 as candidates for constructing our gene circuit.</p><p></p><h3 id="gp2"><a class="anchor" href="#gp2">#</a> <strong>GP2</strong></h3><p>GP2 accounts for ‘T7 Gene Product 2’. It’s an gene product produced by E.coli infected by T7 phage at its early stage. According to Brian Bae et al.(2013), GP2 takes effects by simultaneously binding to RNAP β’ subunit as well as σ70 1.1domain, thus blocking the way DNA should be able to get in. By this process, all transcription process initiated by σ70 can be inhibited.</p><p>~</p><p>We are not the first team to propose GP2 in iGem community. In iGem 2018, Team: Imperial used T7 GP2 to hinder E.coli from growing without killing them, but they didn’t explain why GP2 can’t kill E.coli. We propose two hypothesis about this question. The first one is that, GP2 can inhibit the transcription of the mRNA of itself, thus reaching a balance. (这里最好想要一个 modeling 的图) The second is that, σS will take over σ70 after GP2 is expressed, and keep the cell surviving. Therefore, it’s necessary to introduce a σS-RNAP inhibitor to ensure the inhibition effect.</p><p></p><h3 id="gp57"><a class="anchor" href="#gp57">#</a> <strong>GP5.7</strong></h3><p>GP5.7 accounts for ‘T7 Gene Product 5.7’. It’s an gene product produced by E.coli infected by T7 phage at its middle stage. According to Aline Tabib-Salazar et al.(2018), GP5.7 takes effects by simultaneously binding to RNAP β’ subunit as well as σS R4 domain. By this process, all transcription process initiated by σS can be inhibited.</p><p>~</p><h3 id="σs-promoters"><a class="anchor" href="#σs-promoters">#</a> <strong>σS promoters</strong></h3><p>To prove the effect of GP2 and GP5.7. We need several σ70 promoters and σ70 promoters. While σ70 promoters are everywhere, σS promoters are super rare in iGem community. To solve this problem, we decide to introduce a set of σS promoters ourselves.</p><p>According to Regine Hengge-Aronis(2002), the regulation of σS doesn’t only includes the expression of σS. There’s a complicated regulation procedure. According to Anna Macia˛ g et al.(2011), σS promoters usually feature several UP elements that enable other factors to regulate them. In order to minimize the irrelevant factors, we only cut out about 35bp from those whole σS promoters. Since that might make the promoter lose its properties, we design an experiment to test and verify all the simplified σS promoters we propose.</p><p>σS promoters we propose include: CsiD, osmY, fic and dps, the sequences of which are shown below.</p><p>~<br>Gisela Becker and Regine Hengge-Aronis(2001) has analyzes several σS promoters sequence and found that they have quite conserved sequences in their simplest form. Since csiD and fic didn’t show as strong evidence of being σS promoters as dps and osmY, we decide to improve their sequence manually by introducing spot mutation following Gisela Becker and Regine Hengge-Aronis’s results.

When the concentration of Sso7d increases, DNA loops appear. Finally, DNA becomes a dense nuclear structure at high concentrations of Sso7d. If the time of interaction between Sso7d and DNA increases, the DNA structure tends to be more compact.

In previous studies, Sso7d was suggested to synthesize fusion proteins with DNA polymerase A or DNA polymerase B to largely increase polymerase activity, but no studies have been conducted on the changes in the activity of DNA polymerase Ⅰ and Sso7d fusion proteins. Even so, we still speculated that the activity of Bst DNA polymerase might be improved by linking double-stranded binding proteins, and selected four double-stranded binding proteins from the same hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, Sso7d, Sso10b, DbpA and albA1, for our experiments.
