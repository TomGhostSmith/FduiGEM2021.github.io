synthetic biology, and built bridges for them to access synthetic biology.</p><p>To investigate the barriers, we had interviews with experts studying senior citizens and professors in the field of lifelong education. We also conducted surveys of 87 elderly people across 16 districts in Shanghai.</p><p>Considering the preference of elderly in Shanghai is socializing in the park, we designed posters and promoted synthetic biology and our project in the park. We cataloged all the games produced by previous iGEM teams, and noticed the gap for the elderly so we programmed two new games suitable for the elderly. We also built senior-friendly wiki. We introduced synthetic biology to children with intellectual disabilities in a local Sunshine House and the local university of the third age. Our efforts allow a wider population to access synthetic biology.</p><h1 id="inclusion-of-our-project"><a class="anchor" href="#inclusion-of-our-project">#</a> Inclusion of our project:</h1><p>Inclusion has been deeply rooted in our project -- from the project design to a more comprehensive endeavor to shed light on STEM, we hope to influence as many people as possible.</p><p>Our product aims to provide simple, fast, and cheap detection of C.albicans, a pathogen causing vulvovaginal candidiasis. We paid extra attention to providing access for comprehensive potential users. First, we fully took resource-limited users into consideration. Through the gene circuits we designed, the cost of our product could be tremendously lowered, and poverty will no longer be the barrier to detection for women. What's more, we cared about the simplicity of product usage so that we made vivid video instructions aiding users to carry out the detection in both text and video forms, easy to understand for both children and the elderly.</p><p>Then we turned our attention beyond the project to the broader field of syn biology and the STEM field and trying to help underrepresented groups get more access to science and synthetic biology.</p><p>*<strong>For each activity we carried out, we divide them into three parts: Motivation, details, and summary, with the motivation introducing why and details conveying how we carried out the activity and the summary summarizing what we learn and how the activity shaped inclusivity as a whole.</strong></p><h1 id="build-a-bridge-between-science-and-the-elderly"><a class="anchor" href="#build-a-bridge-between-science-and-the-elderly">#</a> Build a bridge between science and the elderly</h1><h2 id="background-aging-trend"><a class="anchor" href="#background-aging-trend">#</a> Background: aging trend</h2><p>Shanghai, where our team is located, is one of the largest cities both in China and all over the world. By the end of 2020, the registered population of Shanghai has reached 14.7809 million among which the elderly population of 60 and above has been 5.3349 million, <strong>accounting for 36.1% of the total population</strong>.[1]The modern city is challenged by the aging population.</p><p>Aging is more than a local phenomenon, according to the United Nations, there were 727 million persons aged 65 years or over in the world in 2020. Over the next three decades, the global number of older persons is projected to more than double, and <strong>the share of the global population aged 65 years or over is expected to increase from 9.3 percent in 2020 to 16.0 percent by 2050</strong>(United Nations, 2019a)[2]. With such a growing ratio of elderly people among the population, there’s an urgent need for methods to facilitate elderly people to live a better life, preventing them from being lagged in the avalanche of information explosion. As an iGEM team, we were inspired that <strong>we shouldn't exclude the elderly from the iGEM community eithe, and access for the aged to synthetic biology and iGEM projects should be produced and improved!</strong></p><p>Team Fudan 2020 was the first team in the iGEM community to care about the inclusion of elderly people. They visited the elderly people in pension institutions and wrote a textbook teaching youngsters to educate their elder family members. By teaching the elderly people Mulan Quan and imparting health care knowledge to them (<span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly8yMDIwLmlnZW0ub3JnL1RlYW06RnVkYW4vSW5jbHVzaW9u">https://2020.igem.org/Team:Fudan/Inclusion</span>). Team Fudan 2020 endeavored to help the elderly to build a healthier lifestyle, and this year Team Fudan 2021 is building upon our predecessors, hoping to enlarge the influence of our efforts and build a consolidated bridge between iGEM and the aged.</p><h2 id="investigating-in-depth-the-barriers-to-science-for-local-elderly-people"><a class="anchor" href="#investigating-in-depth-the-barriers-to-science-for-local-elderly-people">#</a> Investigating in depth the barriers to science for local elderly people</h2><p>To first get to know systematically about <strong>our target group--local elderly people with age above 60</strong>, we took advantage of literature online, on-campus and off-campus resources. We read research papers (see 2.1), participated in courses discussing the learning ability of elderly people (see 2.2) and we also held a conversation with specialists (see 2.3) to dig deeper into the current problems for elderly to learn (not only synthetic biology) and possible solutions. Finally, we designed a questionnaire ourselves and investigated 96 respondents covering 16 districts of Shanghai to enhance the comprehensiveness of the list of barriers we summarized.</p><h3 id="literature-studying-of-characteristics-of-the-local-elderly"><a class="anchor" href="#literature-studying-of-characteristics-of-the-local-elderly">#</a> Literature studying of characteristics of the local elderly</h3><h4 id="motivation"><a class="anchor" href="#motivation">#</a> Motivation</h4><p>Literatures provide a systematic insight into the elderly's living and learning characteristics.

Each time we got inspired, we turned to the literature for further understandings. (If you are curious about the improvement cycle of inclusivity, see the text below.)</p><h5 id="basic-demography-of-the-elderly-in-shanghai"><a class="anchor" href="#basic-demography-of-the-elderly-in-shanghai">#</a> Basic demography of the elderly in Shanghai</h5><p>By the end of 2020, the registered population of Shanghai has reached 14.7809 million among which the elderly population of 60 and above has been 5.3349 million, <strong>accounting for 36.1% of the total population</strong>.</p><h5 id="the-learning-characteristic-of-the-elderly-in-shanghai"><a class="anchor" href="#the-learning-characteristic-of-the-elderly-in-shanghai">#</a> The learning characteristic of the elderly in Shanghai</h5><p>(1) Significance and goals of learning of the elderly in Shanghai</p><p>First, it is assumed that learning should help lift the elderly's quality of life, which is defined as the elderly's right to their material life, spiritual and cultural life, physical and mental health, their quality and enjoyment, and the overall evaluation of objective conditions and subjective feelings in terms of rights and interests and living environment. [3]</p><p>Plus, with the deepening of aging in Shanghai, a large number of elderly people have left their jobs. Many of them still have a strong demand to continue to serve the community, but because of the lack of learning opportunities and various reasons, their demands have not been well responded to, resulting in a large number of elderly human resources being idle and wasted. Under such a background, providing high-quality education and promoting learning among the elderly is of great practical significance, which prepares the elderly as important human resources. [4]</p><p>(2) Learning needs of the elderly in Shanghai</p><p>In and existing investigation and analysis of the learning purpose of the elderly students in Chengjiaqiao Community School, it is learned that the top five purposes for the elderly students to participate in community school learning activities are **&quot;satisfying their own interests and hobbies&quot;**accounted for 72.8%, 50.6% for <strong>&quot;learning new knowledge and keeping pace with the times&quot;</strong>, 46.2% for <strong>&quot;strong physical fitness, physical and mental health&quot;,</strong> and 31.7% for <strong>&quot;making friends and protecting the circle of communication&quot;</strong>. So visible, a considerable proportion of the elderly into community schools to learn in order to meet their own interests and hobbies, is to improve their own quality, improve themselves: is to constantly charge, constantly learn new knowledge, keep up with the development of the times, keep up with the development of society. [5]</p><h5 id="brief-introduction-of-life-long-education-and-senior-educaiton-in-shanghai-and-globally"><a class="anchor" href="#brief-introduction-of-life-long-education-and-senior-educaiton-in-shanghai-and-globally">#</a> Brief introduction of Life-long education and senior educaiton in Shanghai and globally</h5><p>After interviewing professor Rong Wan (see 2.3.2), we noticed that the group of students of the university of the third age is a group of seniors with strong learning needs, especially those who take health care courses, their content is very relevant to life sciences, medical, and health, and also related to our projects, so <strong>we decided to use the university of third age in Shanghai as a cut-off to build bridges between the seniors and the iGEM community.</strong> We collected relevant information about the senior universities, by browsing the admission information of the various senior universities in Shanghai, visits to senior universities, and we then have some overall understanding of the current curriculum of geriatric universities, in order to follow up the selection of suitable locations for synthetic biology preaching among the students there.</p><p>With the French &quot;third-age university&quot; in 1972 and the founding of the Red Cross University in Shandong Province in 1983 as the symbol, the modern old age education in the West has only gone through more than 40 years of history, while the modern street education in China is only 30 years old, and the old age education is still in the early stage of exploration. In order to solve the problem of the aging of the world's population, the World Congress, held in Vissner in 1982, adopted the Vienna International Plan of Action on Ageing, which raised the issue of the development of education for the elderly, and called on governments around the world to take practical and effective measures to address the development of education for the elderly. There are three main definitions of old age education in domestic academic circles: the first definition of old age education is that &quot;old age education is the later stage of lifelong education, is also an important part of adult education, is a person's life to accept the last branch of the series of education.&quot; The second definition of old age education is that &quot;the study and education activities in the process of old age education are aimed at increasing the knowledge of the humanities of the elderly, in order to enrich the leisure and old life of the elderly, in order to enhance the spiritual quality of the elderly, in order to cultivate the sentiment of the elderly, improve and enhance the health of the elderly&quot;. The third kind defines the connotation of old age education from both broad sense and obtained meaning. <strong>Broadly speaking, geriatric education refers to a variety of colorful, various types of learning and education activities, these activities will have a positive and positive impact on the knowledge and skills of the elderly, physical and mental health level, self-improvement and promotion level. In terms of entitlement, old-age education refers to all learning and educational activities received by older persons at senior universities or at local schools/community schools.[5]</strong></p><h4 id="summary"><a class="anchor" href="#summary">#</a> Summary</h4><p>Through literature study, we can tell that Shanghai has plentiful high-quality education resources-including scientific learning resources for elderly people and the elderly have strong learning desire as well as learning capabilities. However, there are barriers keeping the elderly away from learning such as health conditions, the drain of intellectual ability, and so on. For us, <strong>we were inspired that we should take advantage of the current resources</strong> and connect the elderly to science more broadly while catering to their characteristics and the local public value.</p><h3 id="courses-taking"><a class="anchor" href="#courses-taking">#</a> <strong>Courses taking</strong></h3><h4 id="motivation-2"><a class="anchor" href="#motivation-2">#</a> <strong>Motivation</strong></h4><p>Fudan university is a comprehensive university providing courses of high-quality every summer holiday. These courses are usually themed courses which are taught by several teachers at the same time.

The course focused on how to modify current websites and to make them friendly for senior users which provided us with many<strong>inspirations to modify our wiki pages</strong> to cater to the senior's demand which we will discuss in the following content. (see 3.3) We took the whole process of courses and discussed the topic with professors after class to understand the current barriers to impart knowledge to the old and facilitate their lives solidly and systematically.</p><p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/6/69/T--Fudan--inclusivity17.png" alt="pic"></p><p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/8/82/T--Fudan--inclusivity9.png" alt="pic"></p><p>Fig 1.

Second, the elderly can't use the internet because of health conditions or lacking necessary knowledge and instructions and third, they don't dare to surf the Internet because of the false and fake information by which they can be easily decieved and suffer from financial loss.</p><p><strong>According to the above points, we decided to build an elderly-friendly wiki page which allows the senior to use and get to know about our projects.</strong></p><h3 id="interviews-with-specialists"><a class="anchor" href="#interviews-with-specialists">#</a> Interviews with specialists</h3><h4 id="interviewing-dean-of-monitoring-center-for-lifelong-learning-needs-and-skills"><a class="anchor" href="#interviewing-dean-of-monitoring-center-for-lifelong-learning-needs-and-skills">#</a> Interviewing dean of Monitoring Center for Lifelong Learning Needs and Skills</h4><p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/2/25/T--Fudan--inclusivity13.png" alt="pic"><br>Fig 2.

She told us that Shanghai happens to be the city with most universities for the third age in China and the government provided plentiful resources for the elderly to learn at low costs. She introduced the current system of senior education in Shanghai and suggested us to dig deeper into the elderly's learning needs and characteristics to provide them with useful knowledge in their life which arouses their interests. She mentioned a few points of the elderly's major needs to come to the senior college: to socialize, to seek better knowledge about educating their kids and about their health. What's more, courses such as photography, painting, and sports are more popular than mere health-related lectures so <strong>she suggests that we can think about how to get the aged involved by entertaining them.</strong> Finally, she acknowledged our intention to take the elderly into consideration while promoting our projects and wishing to impart knowledge to the elderly and her researches proved that there is a strong desire to learn among the aged group and that up to <strong>2/5 of the elderly respondents simply had no idea about how to find learning resources and existing access to the knowledge provided by the government, which also became one of the barriers that we decided to tackle with.</strong></p><h5 id="summary-3"><a class="anchor" href="#summary-3">#</a> Summary</h5><p>Professor Zhou provided us with inspiration to take full use of the resouses of Shanghai government-hundreds of universities of the third age in Shanghai and she gave us a list of main reasons that the elderly respondents failed to attend the senior college in her latest research.

It is because there is such a huge gap between the elderly and the lab that resulted in horror and fierce opposition among the elderly against genetic modification, for example. We made a vlog revealing everyday life in the lab and uploaded it onto our bilibili account to give them vivid display of our everyday laboratory life.</p><h4 id="details-10"><a class="anchor" href="#details-10">#</a> Details</h4><p>which received 5395 views, 110 likes and 242 subscribers. <strong>Many of the viewers were grandparents of our team member who got to know about what their grandchildren were doing in the lab for the very first time</strong> and left messages such as &quot;Wish to see more videos&quot;</p><p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/4/4d/T--Fudan--inclusivity11.png" alt="pic"></p><p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/5/58/T--Fudan--inclusivity12.png" alt="pic"></p><p>Fig 9.

Introducing synthetic biology to children of the Sunshine House</p><p>Left picture is the art works of the children dipicting synthetic biology in their mind after our introduction</p><p>Our recent practice feels like a process of gradually opening my eyes and being able to see the world. Even though we see only part of it, even though there are no telescopes, even though the horizon is still there. <strong>The experienc provided us a great shock and we were deeply touched so we decided to share the whole record of our feeling.</strong></p><p>This was the first exposure to Sunshine Home trainees. Although we imagined all kinds of possible situations and made certain psychological preparations when we drew the PPT the night before, the actual situation will always be the one that is accurately out of expectation.</p><p>There were six students in total. A is an older uncle. His cognitive level is not much different from that of ordinary uncle in the park, and he lacks the pride of ordinary uncle in the park. B is a girl of the same age as us. She is careful, shy and does not talk much, but I believe she must use all her feelings in study and communication. C is the aunt generation, from the dressing style, look and speech way, really look no different from ordinary Shanghai aunt; D is a class II intellectual disability, who can only express himself through facial expressions. Illiterate and unable to speak, the degree of mouth opening can be used to distinguish the degree of emotional intensity. E is also uncle level. She likes to talk about the elder generation and shakes hands with us formally when we meet. F is of the same age and feels very smart. Sometimes he is distracted because he is holding a mobile phone. He reminds us of some naughty boys in primary school.</p><h2 id="feelings-of-our-teammember-kana-ren"><a class="anchor" href="#feelings-of-our-teammember-kana-ren">#</a> Feelings of our teammember - Kana Ren</h2><p><strong>Speak slowly</strong></p><p>Speak slowly and clearly. As soon as I met the sunshine House teacher today, language was the first difference I felt. The teacher doesn't speak very fast, and I guess that's the speed that works best for Sunshine Home students in their long-term relationship, so that you can hear them clearly and not be offended.</p><p><strong>Laugh and laugh</strong></p><p>I don't know why, you laugh brilliant! Very sincere. The teacher told me that most of us do not have mobile phones, which means that we do not have such a modern way of self-observation as selfies. I wonder if this is the reason why you know more about what kind of laughter is the most sincere expression of emotion in your heart?</p><p><strong>To be accepted and tolerated</strong></p><p>The content prepared last night was half an hour overtime and only half of it was said. This half is mainly to awaken my various associations as a child, the description of various daily things in life and the way to use words and sentences. Keep it as close to life as possible, use lots of metaphors, and make sure students understand how something as scientific as biology is relevant to everyday life. Perhaps too used to passively accept knowledge input, so sometimes paralyzed as a child active imagination, only to turn my blunt head and some of the barren imagination of the brain circuit weeding. Many of the links I have never thought about since I learned, although some of the links I mentioned can not erase the far-fetched traces of improvism, thanks to the students are also very bought to keep nodding, indicating understanding. As I nodded my head many times, I was moved to be understood and gradually felt that this was a process of being accepted and tolerated by you.</p><p><strong>practice</strong></p><p>I finally came to know and understand the &quot;real&quot; society, or rather, I was allowed to &quot;see&quot; these little parts by embracing the various components of the real world, and tried to piece together in my mind the picture of what society was like.</p><p><strong>Summary and future prospects</strong></p><p>**The success of inclusivity should not be measured by how much so-called scientific knowledge is taught to special groups, but by giving them access to synthetic biology knowledge that society cannot.**At the same time, we also learned about the way such groups receive information from such popular science.</p><p>Aging is a huge and complex problem that could by no means be solved easily, and the intellectual properties of children with disbilities as well as the elderly couldn't be reversed either. However, despite all the barriers we firmly believe that with a strong intention to help the minorities to keep up, we will narrow the digital and information gap for them day by day and impart scientific knowledge to more people to benefit their lives. As for the iGEM community, we hope that we have provided future iGEM teams with inspirations and references to entail and care about elderly people and children with intellectual disabilities in their projects. Since we <strong>uploaded as much editable resources as possible</strong>, we hope our experience can help more people to notice and help such marginalized groups and future teams to build on us.</p><p>Citation</p><ol><li><span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cDovL3dzamt3LnNoLmdvdi5jbi90anNqMi8yMDIwMDUyNy8wNjg3M2U2ZWM4ZjU0YTE1OGMyNTQ3NWRiYmI1NzRhNi5odG1s">http://wsjkw.sh.gov.cn/tjsj2/20200527/06873e6ec8f54a158c25475dbbb574a6.html</span></li><li>World Population Ageing Report (2019) <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudW4ub3JnL3poL2dsb2JhbC1pc3N1ZXMvYWdlaW5n">https://www.un.org/zh/global-issues/ageing</span></li><li>Zhou Yuanpeng and Hong Na.
