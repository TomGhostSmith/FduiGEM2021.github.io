<strong>Overview</strong></h1><p>We conducted a series of SDG activities around women. The focus is on SDG5 -- gender equality, cooperation with SDG10 -- reducing inequality, SDG12 -- responsible production and consumption, SDG16 -- peace justice, and strong institutions. Our activities include organizing and studying the No Period Shaming Project on campus, debates on policies, holding feminism workshops, discussing and improving our project with entrepreneurs, designers, and other stakeholders. In addition, we studied the serious aging problem of Shanghai. We studied the right to get educated, especially intellectually disabled and elderly. Our sustainability studies focus on SDG5, and expanded into other SDGs, with detailed documentation for others to build on in future projects.</p><p>Our project on <em>Candida albicans</em> testing started with keywords including</p><p><strong>menstrual period and vaginal health.</strong></p><p>To achieve our goal, we design and improve our experiments, hoping that one day our paltry effort could help women get better informed of their vaginal health, without the shame of worldly prejudice or real-life difficulty caused by it. For most women in the world, vaginal health is of the same importance as intestinal health or respiratory tract health. They are all part of their body and worthy of equal attention, or even more attention if there’s something wrong with their health condition.</p><p>Not long did we realize that to achieve our goal or in other words get closer, we had to step out of the lab, walk into real life and get more people involved in our project.</p><p>In our process of observation, practice, and reflection, it dawned on us that seventeen <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong>(SDGs) are not isolated but concepts interwoven with each other in our own investigations, interviews, and debates.</p><p>As John Donn has put down the concept of universal relation in poetic words:</p><p><em>'No man is an island.'</em></p><p>The sociality of human beings has put everyone and everything in a universal relation. Sustainable Development Goals are no exception and being beautiful pursuits of human life, they are also part of the universal relation, which are interrelated and interactive. This is an insight we've learned about SDGs from our practice.</p><p>The main concern of our project is SDG5, <strong>Gender Equality</strong>, and other SDGs——SDG10, <strong>Reduced Inequality</strong>, SDG12, <strong>Responsible Consumption and Production</strong> and SDG16, <strong>Peace Justice and Strong Institutions</strong> are also included.</p><h1 id="sdg-5-gender-equality"><a class="anchor" href="#sdg-5-gender-equality">#</a> <strong>SDG 5 Gender Equality</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.</em><br><em>Gender equality is not just a primary human right, but also the cornerstone for peace prosperity, and sustainability of the world.</em><br><em>UN</em></p></blockquote><h1 id="no-period-shaming-projectnpsp-on-campus-of-fudan"><a class="anchor" href="#no-period-shaming-projectnpsp-on-campus-of-fudan">#</a> <strong>No Period Shaming Project(NPSP) on Campus of Fudan</strong></h1><p>The story begins with a packet in the toilet.</p><p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/8/81/T--Fudan--SDG4.JPG" alt="pic"><br>“Being a girl growing up with the habit of taking my menstrual pad everywhere in case of the sudden visit, I was more than surprised to embrace the idea.

Hannah Arendt (Barbara Sukowa), a famous Jewish philosopher who has lived in the United States for many years, is invited by The New Yorker to contribute to the trial. When Hannah Arendt went to Jerusalem to watch the trial, she found a gap between Eichmann's narrative, public opinion, and her own philosophical thinking. As Arendt raised Eichmann's actions to a philosophical level, her essay predictably provoked criticism, with some of Hannah Arendt's old friends breaking with her. The female protege under Heidegger wanted to retreat in the storm but found that everything was not as simple as they expected.</p><p><strong>Awakening Age</strong></p><p>Synopsis:</p><p>The TV series &quot;Awakening Age&quot; from 1915 &quot;Youth magazine&quot; came out to 1921 &quot;new Youth&quot; became the organ publication of the Communist Party of China throughout, showing from the New Culture Movement, the May 4th Movement to the establishment of the Communist Party of China this magnificent historical picture scroll, tells the awakening era of social customs and life in all forms.

However, it wasn’t because of the gender perspective that makes feminism worth learning but because of its tolerant and inclusive nature.</p><p>Here are some feedbacks from our friends and classmates.</p><p><em>Zhu:</em></p><p><em>As a biographical film, the film itself should not focus on one typical event to unfold the character of the subject. Hence, it’s intelligible that apart from detailing the trial of Eichmann, the director depicted a gathering talk at the beginning and cozy acts of Hannah and her husband, which interspersed the movie. Besides being a tough thinker, Hannah was a person who cherished friendship and a wife who deeply loved her spouse, also longing for endearments.</em></p><p><em>When we shift back to the trial, a stunning trick that ought to be mentioned is that the filmmaker shows the original videotape and the scene of Hannah’s response alternately, more explicitly demonstrating the scenario while meantime leaving space for the audience to ‘think’ independently. However, crime couldn’t easily be calculated as punishment and it was unfair to accuse a ‘spike’ of the sin of a whole system. Understanding doesn’t equal forgiving, but it’s a way for us to seek out the underlying ethical or philosophical problems undermining our society and avoid repeating the pain without thorough reflection.</em></p><p><em>What is evil? The end told everyone this question bothered Hannah till she died. The core of Hannah’s theory was the ability to think and it was because of the lack of it that made Eichmann commit a crime, carrying the banality of evil. She called Eichmann a ‘nobody’, giving up thinking and mechanically performing his duty. During Nuremberg Trials, the war criminals claimed to have followed the law and they shouldn’t be punished. If there was something wrong, it should be the law itself. Never had anyone abandoned thinking without reasons, so it’s not enough to only discuss the concept of non-person. Is a bad law a law? Socrates tried to preserve the authority of law, but dramatically he died because of a bad law. We can’t say Socrates is also a ‘nobody’ in that he thought over before accepting the proceedings. The authority of law decides the stability of a nation, but the law should also present a kind of justice deriving from public order and morals. When the law offends justice to an extent that hurts and erodes humanity, the law will be illegal law, losing its validity. Who are to inspect the law? I suppose it should be ourselves. Keeping on thinking protects the completeness of our individuality and revises the law that normalizes society.</em></p><p><em>Hu:</em></p><p><em>There is no doubt that the Age of Awakening, as a tribute to the centenary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, can be said to be excellent. The portrayal of the characters by the old opera and the new generation is very vivid, and the scenes and habits of the characters also make people have a sense of generation. Looking at the awakening era from a personal perspective, it is also to make the process of the founding of the Communist Party of China come alive from the history books. However, as a tribute, it certainly has many shortcomings.</em></p><p><em>One is the concealment of the criticism of the characters. Of course, this is understandable for a tribute film, but it will also mislead some audiences, for example, why Chen Duxiu's two sons call his wife aunt, is because she was the sister of Chen’s former wife, being intellectuals, they shared more opinions and love came in time, they finally eloped together. This is not shown at all in the play except for the title.</em></p><p>**<em>What impressed me most was the neglect of the portrayal of women. The male characters are all vividly portrayed, while female characters are nothing but attachment, plainly put, just lovers of the male characters. Here are really a lot of examples, the elder generation, Gao Junman, and Chen Duxiu, Zhao Renlan and Li Dazhao, Jiang Dongxiu and Hu Shi, the younger generation, Liu Mei and Chen Yannian, Bai Lan and Guo Xingang, Yi Qunxian and He Mengxiong. However, a lack of female portrayal is the biggest problem I think. Being an intellectual though, Kao Junman was just positioned as Chen Duxiu's good wife in the whole film, and she was not smart enough to be with Chen Duxiu as a talent who knows him well. Gao Junman, Zhao Renlan, and Jiang Dongxiu are all portrayed on the identity of the &quot;wife&quot;, while Liu and Bai are also depicted in a bond with Chen and Guo, without whom they almost do not appear. It's fair to say they're fictional characters, so they're not. However, at that time, there was no lack of women worthy of portrayal, but the drama always lacked such a woman who was portrayed as the main supporting role with an independent personality, which was a very uncomfortable and regrettable deficiency of this drama.</em></p><h1 id="sdg-10-reduced-inequality"><a class="anchor" href="#sdg-10-reduced-inequality">#</a> <strong>SDG 10 Reduced Inequality</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>Reduce inequality within and among countries.</em><br><em>UN</em></p></blockquote><h1 id="beyond-our-community-within-our-country"><a class="anchor" href="#beyond-our-community-within-our-country">#</a> <strong>Beyond our community, within our country</strong></h1><h2 id="people-with-intellectual-disabilities-the-right-to-get-educated"><a class="anchor" href="#people-with-intellectual-disabilities-the-right-to-get-educated">#</a> <strong>People with intellectual disabilities: the right to get educated</strong></h2><ul><li>Who are they?</li></ul><p><em>We were thinking the night before about what to call you.

She suggested that our product can be <strong>applied in another scene: production inspection</strong>. And without any reserve, she shared with us her summary of the difficulties of designing for women in business. Here’s her letter and <strong>6 pieces of advice on commercialization</strong>.</p><p>Here's her advice to our project:</p><p><em>Hello, iGEM Team Fudan!</em></p><p><em>The design of this vaginal test kit immediately reminded me of an &quot;AIDS&quot; test kit I saw on campuses around the country five years ago (or so). The team put boxes into machines that were innovative for the time (vending machines are more widely used today) and a successful project</em></p><p><em>The only question is the actual participation rate of the specific purchase/gift of the project, I don't know (you can search it online).</em></p><p><em>According to your design, there is another scene that is also suitable for me: domestic production inspection. Namely, at least one vaginal test during pregnancy. My case is: it is very tiring to wait in line for the equality test in the hospital during late pregnancy. After a process, I feel that there is no need to go to the hospital (the hospital is crowded) if there is a simple test paper</em></p><p><em>Another professional question: I found out I was pregnant in Singapore, and I bought two boxes of pregnancy tests, which can measure the exact period in the first trimester (down to a few weeks). I don't know what the latest science on the test paper was, but it felt very advanced. I also communicated with my friends in China, but they said that this kind of pregnancy test has not appeared on the market</em></p><p><em>There was a time when people thought I had a bad memory when I was pregnant, but it's true</em></p><p><em>Then I would like to combine some of my own experience in women's products with the following suggestions (I am a businessman so I think more about economic questions) :</em></p><p><em>Whether the funds and resources you invested in the early stage can be effectively and forcefully supported, and whether the specific amount is enough for you to make a demo (complete product experience test)</em></p><p><em>Specific and clear market positioning (for people). Whether it is a public welfare route or a capital accumulation route, the direction should be clear, which is more helpful to future development (team development)</em></p><p><em>Your design can be developed in two ways (personal suggestion): In China, women's issues are still wandering among first-tier cities. We can try to integrate some pure design flows and take a conceptual display route of design concepts (such as cooperation with art centers). Secondly, we can implement physical products, that is, make your products available to the hospitals in the village and the people who need them the most.</em></p><p><em>Also, I haven't query data, but this kind of design should not be your sole, so what is your team's core competitiveness, have not been with a category instead of the advantages of (this don't try so hard, can do slowly found) if you can go to the end, fully implement the plan, your advantage is that a few of you (it is difficult to achieve, Most teams just walk away)</em></p><p><em>In addition, in the initial production/market of any product there are only two ways :(1) a way of small profits and quick sales (business logic, specific not to expand) can use the least cost, the fastest speed to do the largest scale promotion. (2) Small but refined, this choice takes time in terms of manpower, material resources, and energy. It is a road in line with China's future market, but difficult to take (all categories are being upgraded at present).</em></p><p><em>Lastly, it is impossible to find the most suitable partner (physical materials) for any project at the very beginning. You can cast a wide net to catch the big fish.</em></p><p><em>This one depends on your luck, but also your strength. The world is fair, big carrot for the big hole.</em></p><h1 id="sdg-16-peace-justice-and-strong-institutions"><a class="anchor" href="#sdg-16-peace-justice-and-strong-institutions">#</a> <strong>SDG 16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions</strong></h1><blockquote><p><em>Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.</em><br><em>UN</em></p></blockquote><h1 id="debate-should-free-menstrual-products-be-legislated-in-china"><a class="anchor" href="#debate-should-free-menstrual-products-be-legislated-in-china">#</a> <strong>Debate: should free menstrual products be legislated in China?</strong></h1><ul><li>Who are they?</li></ul><p><strong>Two debate teams participated was from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.</strong> Medical background enables two teams to see menstruation issues more objectively, or in other words, with fewer prejudices. We hope that there will be fewer biases in such a debate, and increase thinking depth in the activity of no period shame.</p><ul><li>Why did we choose the topic?</li></ul><p>The debate is proposed by our team. The idea came from 《<strong>Period Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Bill》, which was voted by the Scottish parliament</strong> on November 24, 2020. Passage of the bill means that public places in Scotland, including primary and secondary schools and universities, will provide free menstrual products, and local government and education institutions will be obliged to guarantee a free supply of Menstrual products.</p><p><strong>We wanted to discuss to what extent could the bill apply to China.</strong></p><ul><li>What did we learn in the debate?</li></ul><p><em>The main points of pro are as follows:</em></p><p><em>1. The poor tend to choose cheap menstrual products because of economic burdens.</em></p><p><em>2. It is sub-quality or improperly stored menstrual products that lead to a higher risk of gynecological diseases.</em></p><p><em>3. Women are burdened by physical differences that could lead to gender poverty.</em></p><p><em>The solution they proposed was that, for the upstream, lower down the price through the centralized procurement with a quality guarantee, and for the downstream, the school should play a role in completing the distribution of free menstrual products to student groups, the street committee, and village cadres should cover the other group in need. The main advantage of the scheme is that qualified menstrual products can greatly reduce the incidence of gynecological diseases, which are represented by Candida albicans, and the total cost, in general, could be less than the total treatment fee. Besides the scheme can promote gender equality, and make women better exert their own potential, and create their own value. But the problem is that centralized procurement can lead to a decline in quality or corruption.</em></p><p><em>The main points of the opposite are as follows:</em></p><p><em>1. The executive force may not be able to achieve the desired results and could instead easily breed corruption.</em></p><p><em>2. That may cause a waste of resources.</em></p><p><em>3. A major cultural factor of menstrual poverty is the bad tradition of “value the male child only”, and the legislation of menstrual products might be near enough nowhere.</em></p><p><em>The target solution is to include the period items in health care or tax breaks to reduce the price of menstrual products. But the problem is that tax breaks may have little effect and not really make some poor families affordable. The idea of inclusion in health care is more feasible.</em></p><p><em>Although the two sides are in a different position because of the pros and cons of the debate, they are thinking about the crucial issues of menstrual poverty and gender equality, and the opinions on key issues are consistent: we need to act for women's menstrual poverty, especially in the macro level of politics. For women in China, especially in underdeveloped areas, women are better able to accept education and self-fulfillment, and we can do a lot more.</em></p><p><img data-src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/2/24/T--Fudan--SDG10.JPG" alt="pic"><br>For <strong>further links between theory and practice, we turn to experts in sociology</strong>.</p><h1 id="interview-dr-shen-ke-lecture-analyzing-chinas-equality-policy"><a class="anchor" href="#interview-dr-shen-ke-lecture-analyzing-chinas-equality-policy">#</a> <strong>Interview: Dr. Shen Ke Lecture analyzing China's equality policy</strong></h1><ul><li>Who is she?</li></ul><p>Professor <strong>Shen Ke</strong>was a<strong>n expert on population policy and intergenerational relationships</strong> and has published several influential articles on <em>Population and Development Review</em>, <em>Demography</em>, <em>BMC Geriatrics</em>, <em>Eurasian Geography and Economics, Demographic Research, Chinese Sociological Review, Journal of the Economics of Ageing</em>.</p><ul><li>How did we meet?</li></ul><p>We interviewed Professor Ke Shen after her online lecture named t<strong>he mixed blessing of living together or close by, which was an insightful observation about China’s gender policy and culture</strong>.</p><ul><li>What did we learn?</li></ul><p>Professor Shen illustrated her findings of women’s labor participation rate and filial responsibility with solid statistics.</p><p>She mentioned <strong>the impact of the Opening and Reform Policy on women's employment ensuring policy</strong>. Before the policy was implemented, all work was distributed to certain groups of people and gender didn’t play much of a role in the distribution process. However, the policy led to market-oriented reform, therefore all got their job through market competition, in which men won advantage over women in most cases. For instance, if a woman gives birth to a child and takes maternity leave, she might be denied an opportunity to promote or further study accordingly. On the other hand, men seldom take their paternity leave in China. That’s <strong>where inequality comes in</strong>.</p><p>We got a gender view on the seemingly glorious Opening and Reform policy and learned that inequality might be created even it was long thought
